# Flashing-LED-2

Hi,                        
As i gave you the information about previous respositry (https://github.com/shubh0811/Flashing-LED) ,this respositry is the 2nd part of it.
In this respositry i have added a capacitor as well as a LED, which makes it to be two capacitor and two LED.


                                                                             
                                                                             



It is the simple connection made, you can use the schematic if you wish to make the project.


As i said in previous respositry if you wish to up-down the timing of the LED glowing and 
extinguishing ,you need to change the value of capacitor using.

I have also added the video of my final observation, pleave go through it.

 ## COMPONENTS USED

1)LED's                                                                             
2)Transistor- BC547                      
3)Few jumper wires                                                 
4)Resistor- 47kohm, 100 ohm                                                                                                       
5)Capacitor- 10uf                                                                              
6) Batter-9v or less may also work
